### Library

This example signs into an [Outlook](https://outlook.live.com) account, searches for a given query, and then parses and returns all emails returned for that query.

```bash
npm install --save puppeteer-email
npm install --save puppeteer-email-provider-outlook
```

```js
const PuppeteerEmail = require('puppeteer-email')
const PuppeteerEmailProviderOutlook = require('puppeteer-email-provider-outlook')

const provider = new PuppeteerEmailProviderOutlook()
const client = new PuppeteerEmail(provider)

const username = 'XXX'
const password = 'XXX'

const session = await client.signin({ username, password })
const emails = await session.getEmails({ query: 'from:github' })
await session.close()
```
