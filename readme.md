### Library

This example signs into an [Outlook](https://outlook.live.com) account, searches for a given query, and then parses and returns all emails returned for that query.

```bash
npm install --save puppeteer-email
```

```js
const PuppeteerEmail = require('puppeteer-email')

const client = new PuppeteerEmail('outlook')

const username = 'XXX'
const password = 'XXX'

const session = await client.signin({ username, password })
const emails = await session.getEmails({ query: 'from:github' })
await session.close()

console.log(emails)
```

Example parsed email output:

```js
[
  {
    "attachments": [ /* ... */ ],
    "headers": { /* ... */ },
    "html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>...</html>",
    "text": "...",
    "textAsHtml": "<p>...</p>",
    "subject": "Example email subject",
    "date": "2018-05-09T14:17:02.000Z",
    "to": {
      "value": [
        {
          "address": "fischxxxx@outlook.com",
          "name": "Travis Fischer"
        }
      ],
      "html": "<span class=\"mp_address_name\">Travis Fischer</span> &lt;<a href=\"mailto:fischxxxx@outlook.com\" class=\"mp_address_email\">fischxxxx@outlook.com</a>&gt;",
      "text": "Travis Fischer <fischxxxx@outlook.com>"
    },
    "from": {
      "value": [
        {
          "address": "noreply@github.com",
          "name": "GitHub"
        }
      ],
      "html": "<span class=\"mp_address_name\">GitHub</span> &lt;<a href=\"mailto:noreply@github.com\" class=\"mp_address_email\">noreply@github.com</a>&gt;",
      "text": "GitHub <noreply@github.com>"
    },
